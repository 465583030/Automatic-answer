    Man: Was it that new restaurant over on Fourth Street?

    Man: Because Jerry ate there last week and had the same kind of problem. He was sick the next day, too.

    Script:         Morgan Robertson, in 1898, wrote Futility. It described the maiden voyage of a transatlantic luxury liner named the Titan. Although it was praised as being unsinkable, it strikes an iceberg and sinks with much loss of life. In 1912 the Titanic, a transatlantic luxury liner widely praised as unsinkable struck an iceberg and sank with great loss of life on her maiden voyage. In the book, the Month of the Wreck was April, same as in the real event. There were 3,000 passengers on the book; in reality, 2,207. In the book, there were 24 lifeboats; in reality, 20.
            Months after the Titanic sank, a tramp steamer was traveling through the foggy Atlantic with only a young boy on watch. It came into his head that it had been thereabouts that the Titanic had sunk, and he was suddenly terrified by the thought of the name of his ship ― the Titanian. Panic-stricken, he sounded the warning. The ship stopped, just in time: a huge iceberg loomed out of the fog directly in their path. The Titanian was saved.

            In September 1955, James Dean was killed in a horrific car accident whilst he was driving his Porsche sports car. After the crash the car was seen as very unlucky.
            When the car was pulled away from the accident scene and taken to a garage, the engine slipped out and fell onto a mechanic, shattering both of his legs.
            Eventually the engine was bought by a doctor, who put it into his racing car and was killed shortly afterwards, during a race. Another racing driver, in the same race, was killed in his car, which had a part of James Dean's car fitted to it.
            When James Dean's Porsche was later repaired, the garage it was in was destroyed by fire.
            Later the car was displayed in Sacramento, but it fell off its mount and broke a teenager's hip.
            In Oregon, the trailer that the car was mounted on slipped from its towbar and smashed through the front of a shop.

            However, by strange coincidence his older brother Finn went on a tour of the police station a few days later with the Cubs and spotted the missing toy car in their lost property room.
            As a result, Fergus was reunited with the toy, which had been handed into the police by a kind soul who had found it on St Leonards Road.
            The boys' mom Kirsten told the News: "We are so grateful someone handed it into the police.
            "I was surprised anyone had done so ― the toy is a bit shabby as it originally belonged to Finn when he was a toddler and he is now 10-years-old."
            "When Fergus gets to his gran and papa's the first thing he does is look for it and he was so sad when it was gone. He was really excited when he got it back as we all thought it was gone forever."
            "We'd like to thank the kind person who handed it in."
            Sergeant Stuart Cluckie of East Kilbride Police added: "People aren't aware of the distress their actions can cause in situations like this."

    Section C 

    Directions: In this section, you will hear a passage three times. When the passage is read for the first time, you should listen carefully for its general idea. When the passage is read for the second time, you are required to fill in the blanks with the exact words you have just heard. Finally, when the passage is read for the third time, you should check what you have written.

(This means that, in dealing the hand, there exist as many as 635,000,000,000 different hands that may possibly appear.) What statisticians tell us, though, is that these billions of hands are all equally likely to occur, and that one of them is absolutely certain to occur each time the hand is dealt. Thus, any hand that is dealt, including the most rare and improbable hand is, in terms of probability, merely one of a number of equally likely events, one of which was (30)_________________ to happen.

    Script:         At some time or another it happens to all of us. There's that certain number that pops up wherever you go. Hotel rooms, airline terminals, street addresses ― its haunting presence cannot be escaped. Or, you're in your car, absently humming a song. You turn on the radio. A sudden chill prickles your spine. That same song is now pouring from the speaker.
            Coincidence, you tell yourself. Or is it?
            For most mainstream scientists, experiences like this, however strange and recurrent, are nothing but lawful expressions of chance, a creation ― not of the divine or mystical ― but of simply that which is possible. Ignorance of natural law, they argue, causes us to fall prey to superstitious thinking, inventing supernatural causes where none exist. In fact, say these statistical law-abiding rationalists, the occasional manifestation of the rare and improbable in daily life is not only permissible, but inevitable.
            Consider this: from a well-shuffled deck of fifty-two playing cards, the mathematical odds of dealing a hand of thirteen specified cards are about 635,000,000,000 to one. (This means that, in dealing the hand, there exist as many as 635,000,000,000 different hands that may possibly appear.) What statisticians tell us, though, is that these billions of hands are all equally likely to occur, and that one of them is absolutely certain to occur each time the hand is dealt. Thus, any hand that is dealt, including the most rare and improbable hand is, in terms of probability, merely one of a number of equally likely events, one of which was bound to happen.
